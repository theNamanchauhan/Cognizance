> Astronomy : Mini Encyclopedia for Our Universe
---
* Outer space, commonly shortened to space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere and between celestial bodies.
* Outer space is not completely empty‚Äîit is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays.



## <span style="color:darkgrey;">__Motivation behind this page__
---
I used to many times see the stars in the sky at night and Wondered there also exists an entirely different world far away from the Busy life and competitive world, Where there is no Disturbance, no race for marks.<br>
<br>
Even Sometimes it feels like how Amazing is the world which we see in the sky.The world without limits, full of undiscovered adventures and creatures.
<br>
All these thoughts bring up a feeling for learning about that space which is not only what we just see with our eyes in the sky but far more vast.
<br>
<br>
This motivated me to make a website which contains many facts and information on "Life Beyond limits", I would like to say. This webpage is a type of mini encyclopedia, we can say rather.
## <span style="color:gold;">__Future Improvements__
---
* As I called Earlier also this webpage is a kind of mini encyclopedia, I would like to make it more vast and will try to cover more things of the Outer Space in this webpage.<br><br>
* I will also be very intreseted to make a *prototype* from this webpage as well as I will try to improve the *Design* and *overall* graphics of the webpage and try to provide Quality information which can be easily available to the user, thus making it more *user-friendly*.
## <span style="color:orange;">__Learning Outcomes__</span>
---
Firstly, I would like to share something. I created a webpage or basically a landing page in Cultural education end semester project on the Topic _Mysterious Temples in india_  in my first semseter in college. While making the webpage it was very difficult for me to imagine a webpage and then try making it practically. Sometimes I have to delete whatever I had done because it was not looking good. Basically, I was lacking a kind of map or I can say a blueprint of my website which can guide me how I have to proceed and before writting the code for that particular thing I would get to know how it would look like and save my time by reducing errors.<br>
When I get to know while doing cognizance task actually this was the solution, I was looking for. I really felt amazed and also enjoyed making a landing page in Adobe XD.
Thank you Cognizance!! for Such a task.
